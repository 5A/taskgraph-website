# Overview

This is currently a sketch version of the documentation.
Because the APIs and design are still changing,
the documentation is expected to be polished when the stable version
is released.

The documentation will walk you through detailed environment setup,
backend deployment and dev guide, backend API explainations,
frontend dev env setup, encryption and authentication setup,
and static content deployment guides, etc..
